# GitHub App Setup

The following open source [Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/use-app-token) helps to generate a GitHub App token for you which can then be passed into the `combine-prs` Action.

Here is an example doing exactly that:

```yaml
name: Combine PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1 * * 3' # Wednesday at 01:00
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  combine-prs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Use GitHub App Token
        uses: wow-actions/use-app-token@d7957e08172ca2e8e49b35b8d266ad585885edc7 # pin@v2.0.2
        id: generate_token
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }} # The ID of the GitHub App
          private_key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }} # The private key of the GitHub App
          fallback: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # fall back to the default token if the app token is not available

      - name: combine-prs
        uses: github/combine-prs@vX.X.X # where X.X.X is the latest version
        with:
          github_token: ${{ steps.generate_token.outputs.BOT_TOKEN }} # A GitHub app token generated by the previous step
```

If you go the GitHub App route, it will need the following permissions for your GitHub App:

- Commit statuses: `Read-only`
- Contents: `Read and write`
- Metadata: `Read-only`
- Pull requests: `Read and write`
